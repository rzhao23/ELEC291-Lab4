# ELEC 291 Lab 4 – LRC Meter (555 Timer)

This repository is used for version control and collaboration for **ELEC 291 Lab 4**.

The project implements an **LRC meter** based on a **self-built 555 timer**, capable of measuring inductance, capacitance, and resistance using a single configurable circuit and software control.

---

## Project Overview

The system measures electrical components by analyzing the frequency of a square wave generated by a 555 timer circuit.  
A Schmitt trigger is used to clean the output signal before it is processed.

Measurement modes are selected using hardware switches, while system operation is controlled through a command-line interface (CLI).

## Features

### 1. Full LRC Meter
- Measures **inductance (L)**, **capacitance (C)**, and **resistance (R)**
- All measurements are supported by a single system

### 2. Switch-Controlled Circuit
- Hardware switches select between **L meter**, **C meter**, and **R meter**
- No manual rewiring or circuit modification is required

### 3. Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Full command-line control of the LRC meter
- Used to:
  - Select measurement modes
  - Start and stop measurements
  - Display measurement results

### 4. Detection Pause System
- Measurement automatically pauses when:
  - The component is unplugged
  - The measured value exceeds the supported range
- Prevents invalid or unstable readings

### 5. LED Indicator
- LED provides capacitance range feedback:
  - **Solid ON**: capacitance is within range
  - **Blinking**: capacitance exceeds measurable range

### 6. Schmitt Trigger Filtering
- A Schmitt trigger filters the noisy square wave produced by the 555 timer
- Ensures a clean and stable digital signal for accurate measurement
